## Quick Start

1. **Run all examples in sequence:**
```bash
cd examples
python 1_basic_usage.py
python 2_graph_metrics.py  
python 3_advanced_memory.py
python 4_integrated_brownian.py --iterations 50 --particles 20  # Quick demo
```

2. **Check output:**
```bash
ls output/  # View generated images and movies
```

## Requirements

All examples require:
- **Core**: numpy, opencv-python, python-igraph, scipy
- **Optional**: For movie creation in example 4, ensure OpenCV is properly installed

## Learning Path

**Beginner**: Start with `1_basic_usage.py` to understand core concepts

**Intermediate**: Move to `2_graph_metrics.py` to learn analysis techniques

**Advanced**: Explore `3_advanced_memory.py` for temporal graphs

**Expert**: Run `4_integrated_brownian.py` for complete simulations

## Output Files

Each example creates output in the `examples/output/` directory:
- **Images**: Individual graph visualizations (.jpg)
- **Movies**: Dynamic simulations (.mp4) 
- **Data**: Statistics and analysis results

## Troubleshooting

**Coordinate system issues**: Examples 1 and 2 demonstrate proper coordinate alignment

**Memory errors**: Example 3 shows memory management best practices  

**Performance issues**: Example 4 includes optimization techniques for large simulations

**Import errors**: Check that all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install opencv-python python-igraph scipy numpy
```

## Extending the Examples
