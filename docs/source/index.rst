*A powerful, fast, and flexible Python library for building and analyzing graphs from 2D spatial data*

Graphizy specializes in creating comprehensive graph types from point data, with advanced memory-enhanced analysis for temporal patterns, sophisticated weight computation systems, and real-time streaming capabilities. Built on OpenCV and igraph, it provides a modern unified API for graph construction and comprehensive analytics.

Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: python

   from graphizy import Graphing, GraphizyConfig, generate_and_format_positions

   # Generate sample data
   data = generate_and_format_positions(size_x=800, size_y=600, num_particles=100)

   # Configure and create grapher
   config = GraphizyConfig(dimension=(800, 600))  
   grapher = Graphing(config=config)

   # Create different graph types using unified interface
   delaunay_graph = grapher.make_graph("delaunay", data)
   proximity_graph = grapher.make_graph("proximity", data, proximity_thresh=50.0)
   knn_graph = grapher.make_graph("knn", data, k=4)
   mst_graph = grapher.make_graph("mst", data)
   gabriel_graph = grapher.make_graph("gabriel", data)

   # Visualize results
   image = grapher.draw_graph(delaunay_graph)
   grapher.show_graph(image, "Delaunay Graph")
   grapher.save_graph(image, "delaunay.jpg")

   # Comprehensive graph analysis
   info = grapher.get_graph_info(delaunay_graph)
   print(f"Density: {info['density']:.3f}")
   print(f"Connected: {info['is_connected']}")
   
   # Resilient centrality analysis
   betweenness = grapher.call_method_safe(delaunay_graph, 'betweenness')
   connectivity_info = grapher.get_connectivity_info(delaunay_graph)
