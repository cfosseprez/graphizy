Real-World Applications
---------------------

**Paramecium Population Analysis**

Graphizy provides specialized tools for studying topological interactions in microbial communities:

.. code-block:: python

   # Real-time analysis of Paramecium populations
   def analyze_paramecium_swarm(tracking_data):
       """
       Analyze collective behavior in Paramecium populations
       
       tracking_data: Real-time position data from microscopy
       """
       grapher = Graphing()
       grapher.init_memory_manager(max_memory_size=200, track_edge_ages=True)
       
       temporal_networks = []
       for frame_data in tracking_data:
           # Create proximity network
           graph = grapher.make_graph("proximity", frame_data, 
                                    proximity_thresh=50.0)  # 50 micrometers
           
           # Update memory for temporal analysis
           grapher.update_memory_with_graph(graph)
           temporal_networks.append(graph)
       
       # Analyze swarm dynamics
       result = grapher.get_graph_info(temporal_networks[-1])
       
       # Social structure analysis
       roles = result.social_analyzer.track_temporal_roles(temporal_networks)
       
       # Percolation behavior
       percolation = result.percolation_analyzer.analyze_percolation_threshold(
           tracking_data[-1], [20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
       )

   # Convert analysis results to DataFrame
   df = pd.DataFrame([
       {
           'node_id': node_id,
           'role': role.roles[0] if role.roles else 'regular',

       }
       for node_id, role in social_roles.items()
   ])
   
   # Save for R/Python statistical analysis
   df.to_csv('social_network_analysis.csv', index=False)

       "point_radius": 8,
       "line_thickness": 2,
       "point_color": (100, 150, 255),
       "line_color": (255, 100, 100)
   })
   
   # Create memory-enhanced visualization
   memory_graph = grapher.make_memory_graph(data)
   image = grapher.draw_memory_graph(memory_graph, 
                                   use_age_colors=True,
                                   alpha_range=(0.3, 1.0))
