======================

Graphizy provides comprehensive graph analysis capabilities through its integration with igraph and custom analysis methods. This section documents all available analysis interfaces and their usage.

Analysis Method Categories
--------------------------

Graphizy offers three levels of analysis access:

1. **High-Level API**: Convenient methods for common analysis tasks
2. **Direct igraph Access**: Full access to 200+ igraph algorithms
3. **Custom Analysis**: User-defined analysis functions

.. note::
   All analysis methods work with any graph type (Delaunay, Proximity, K-NN, MST, Memory-enhanced).

High-Level Analysis API
-----------------------

**Graph Information Summary:**

.. code-block:: python

   # Get comprehensive graph overview
   info = grapher.get_graph_info(graph)
   
   # Returns dictionary with:
   # - vertex_count: Number of nodes
   # - edge_count: Number of edges  
   # - density: Edge density (0-1)
   # - is_connected: Connectivity status
   # - average_path_length: Mean shortest path length
   # - diameter: Maximum shortest path length
   # - transitivity: Global clustering coefficient

**Example Output:**

.. code-block:: python

   {
       'vertex_count': 100,
       'edge_count': 287,
       'density': 0.058,
       'is_connected': True,
       'average_path_length': 3.42,
       'diameter': 8,
       'transitivity': 0.156
   }

   # Returns: {node_id: degree_count, ...}
   # Example: {0: 5, 1: 3, 2: 7, ...}
   
   # Usage examples
   most_connected = max(connections.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
   avg_connections = sum(connections.values()) / len(connections)

   degree_assortativity = grapher.call_method(graph, 'assortativity_degree')
   print(f"Degree assortativity: {degree_assortativity:.4f}")
   
   # Interpretation:
   # > 0: Similar degree nodes prefer to connect (assortative)
