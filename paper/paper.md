# Graphizy: Memory-Enhanced Graph Construction for Computational Geometry and Temporal Network Analysis

## Summary

Graphizy is a Python package that provides a unified framework for constructing and analyzing graphs from spatial data with a novel memory-enhanced system for temporal network analysis. Unlike existing graph libraries that focus primarily on static graph analysis, Graphizy specializes in the dynamic construction of graphs from point data using computational geometry algorithms, while maintaining temporal memory of connections for longitudinal analysis. The package integrates multiple graph construction methods—including Delaunay triangulation, proximity graphs, k-nearest neighbors, minimum spanning trees, and Gabriel graphs—with a unified API that enables real-time graph evolution tracking and visualization.

## Statement of Need

Graph-based analysis of spatial data is fundamental across numerous scientific domains, from analyzing social animal behavior and ecological networks to studying particle dynamics and urban spatial structures. However, existing tools often fall short in three critical areas:

1. **Dynamic Graph Construction**: While libraries like NetworkX [@hagberg2008networkx] excel at analyzing pre-existing graphs, they lack specialized tools for efficiently constructing graphs from evolving spatial point data.

2. **Temporal Memory Systems**: Traditional graph analysis treats each time step independently, losing valuable information about connection persistence and temporal patterns that are crucial for understanding dynamic systems.

3. **Computational Geometry Integration**: Existing solutions require researchers to manually integrate multiple libraries (SciPy for triangulation, NetworkX for analysis, matplotlib for visualization), creating friction in the research workflow.

Graphizy addresses these gaps by providing a specialized framework designed specifically for researchers working with spatial-temporal data who need to construct, analyze, and visualize evolving graph structures. The package's memory-enhanced system enables novel analyses of connection stability, temporal clustering, and network evolution patterns that are not readily available in existing tools.

## Key Features and Innovations

### Memory-Enhanced Graph System

Graphizy's primary innovation is its memory-enhanced graph system, which tracks the temporal persistence of connections across multiple time steps. This system enables researchers to:

- **Analyze Connection Stability**: Identify which spatial relationships persist over time versus those that are transient
- **Visualize Temporal Patterns**: Display connection age through color-coding and transparency effects  
- **Quantify Network Dynamics**: Calculate metrics such as connection lifetime distributions and temporal clustering coefficients

```python
# Initialize memory system
grapher.init_memory_manager(max_memory_size=100, track_edge_ages=True)

# Update over time
for timestep in simulation_data:
    current_graph = grapher.make_delaunay(timestep)
    grapher.update_memory_with_graph(current_graph)
    
    # Create memory-enhanced graph combining current + historical connections
    memory_graph = grapher.make_memory_graph(timestep)
    
    # Visualize with age-based coloring
    visualization = grapher.draw_memory_graph(memory_graph, use_age_colors=True)
```

### Unified Computational Geometry API

The package provides a consistent interface for multiple graph construction algorithms commonly used in spatial analysis:

- **Delaunay Triangulation**: Optimal triangular meshes for spatial interpolation and mesh generation
- **Proximity Graphs**: Distance-based connectivity for neighborhood analysis
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Fixed-degree networks for local clustering analysis
- **Minimum Spanning Trees**: Minimal connectivity for hierarchical analysis
- **Gabriel Graphs**: Geometric proximity graphs for shape analysis

All methods share a common API pattern and return igraph objects for downstream analysis:

```python
# Unified API across all graph types
positions = generate_positions(800, 600, 100)  # Generate test data
data = np.column_stack((np.arange(100), positions))

delaunay_graph = grapher.make_delaunay(data)
proximity_graph = grapher.make_proximity(data, proximity_thresh=50.0)
knn_graph = grapher.make_knn(data, k=4)
mst_graph = grapher.make_mst(data)
gabriel_graph = grapher.make_gabriel(data)
```

### Performance-Optimized Implementation

Graphizy is designed for real-time applications with performance optimizations including:

- **OpenCV Integration**: Leverages optimized C++ implementations for computational geometry
- **Vectorized Operations**: NumPy-based calculations for efficient large-scale processing
- **Memory Management**: Configurable memory systems with automatic cleanup
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple datasets

Performance benchmarks demonstrate construction times of <50ms for graphs with 1000+ nodes on standard hardware.

### Extensible Plugin Architecture

The package includes a plugin system for adding custom graph types:

```python
from graphizy.plugins import GraphTypePlugin, register_graph_type

@register_graph_type
class CustomGraphPlugin(GraphTypePlugin):
    @property
    def info(self):
        return GraphTypeInfo(
            name="custom_graph",
            description="Custom graph construction algorithm",
            parameters={"threshold": {"type": float, "default": 1.0}}
        )
    
    def create_graph(self, data_points, aspect, dimension, **kwargs):
        # Custom implementation
        return graph
```

nx_graph = grapher.to_networkx(graphizy_graph)

# Perform NetworkX analysis
centrality = nx.betweenness_centrality(nx_graph)
communities = nx.community.greedy_modularity_communities(nx_graph)
```

    positions += np.random.normal(0, 1, positions.shape)
    data = np.column_stack((np.arange(len(positions)), positions))
    
    # Update memory with current connections
    current_graph = grapher.make_proximity(data, proximity_thresh=60.0)
    grapher.update_memory_with_graph(current_graph)
    
    # Create memory-enhanced visualization
    if timestep % 10 == 0:
        memory_graph = grapher.make_memory_graph(data)
        image = grapher.draw_memory_graph(memory_graph, use_age_colors=True)
        grapher.save_graph(image, f"temporal_frame_{timestep:03d}.png")
